## What is GitHub?  
<!---Make notes or comments that won't be rendered using this syntax--->

[**GitHub**](https://github.com) is an open-source development platform that enables easy collaboration and versioning, which means that all saved versions are archived and attributed to each user. It is possible to revert back to any previous version, which is incredibly useful to not only to document what work has been done, but how it differs from work done in the past, and who is responsible for the changes.

Similar to Dropbox, you have certain folders on your local computer that will be synched online, although you have more control about the synching. You can store, share, track changes and collaboratively edit many filetypes (including this [presentation]!), using any program to edit, and can use a shared to-do list (called Issues). 

## Why use GitHub?  

So many reasons to use GitHub. Personal organization, backing up, version control, collaboration, sharing. . .

Nicely explained by Hadley Wickham in his  [Git and GitHub Tutorial](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) 

And also by Karl Broman in his [GitHub Tutorial](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/why.html)

## GitHub Structure

GitHub stores files in **repositories**, owned by an **organization**.  

Repositories ('repos') are essentially folders containing scripts and small text files. Repositories are version controlled so that any modifications to files, additions or deletions, are tracked and attributed to contributors with the correct permissions. 

* [eco-data-science](https://github.com/eco-data-science) is an **organization**
* [github-intro](https://github.com/OHI-Science/github-intro) is a **repository**

## GitHub Vocabulary

All collaborators will work locally on their own computers, syncing their changes back online so others work from the most current version.

* **clone**: download to your computer from online version with synching capabilities enabled
* **commit**: message associated with your changes (see some [best practices](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#commit-best-practices))
* **pull**: sync a repo on your computer with online version
* **push**: sync the online repo with your version, only possible after committing

**sync = pull + commit + push**


## GitHub Vocabulary

**sync = pull + commit + push**

## Filepaths

Because you will be working collaboratively with others, where you store your files makes a big difference. 

Save any GitHub repos is a folder in your home directory called ***'github'***, so that you can access it with the filepath `~/github`. 

* **Windows**: `Users\[User]\Documents\github\`
* **Mac**: `Users/[User]/github/`


## Cloning and Synching Options

You will clone a repository to your computer so you can work offline. 

When you work on your computer, any edits you make to any files in your repo, using any program, will be tracked by GitHub. You can then commit and sync your changes back to GitHub. There are many options you can use to first clone and then sync your edits on a repo with the online version:

* **GitHub App** [for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) and [for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
* [**RStudio**](www.rstudio.com)
* **shell (Terminal on Mac)**
 
## Cloning Examples

We will walk through two examples: 

1. clone a repository using the GitHub app  
2. clone a repository using RStudio.

You can also clone using the shell (we will not discuss that here).

## Synching Examples

We will walk through two examples: 

1. create a new file in Excel, save as *.csv* in your repo, commit, pull, push using GitHub App.  
2. modify R script using RStudio, commit, pull, push from RStudio.

You can also synch using the shell but we will not discuss that here.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps, referring to the Ocean Health Index Manual's section on [Installing the Toolbox](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#installing-the-toolbox) for more detailed instructions. 

1. Create a [GitHub](http://github.com) account 
2. Download and install [*git*](http://git-scm.com/downloads) software
3. Set up your git identity
4. Install the GitHub application
5. Create a folder called  ***github*** on your computer
5. Email your GitHub username to Julie so you can finally: 
6. Clone your repository to your computer

Now you can work locally, synching your edits back to the online repositories!
