## What is GitHub?

[**GitHub**](https://github.com) is an open-source development platform that enables easy collaboration and versioning, which means that all saved versions are archived and attributed to each user. It is possible to revert back to any previous version, which is incredibly useful to not only to document what work has been done, but how it differs from work done in the past, and who is responsible for the changes.

Similar to Dropbox, you have certain folders on your local computer that will be 'watched', with any changes able to be synched online. However, with GitHub, you have more control about what is synched, and how often. You can store, share, track changes and collaboratively edit many filetypes (including this [presentation](https://github.com/eco-data-science/github-intro/blob/master/index.rmd)!), using any program to edit. There are many other great features, including a to-do list you can share with collaborators (called Issues). 

## Why use GitHub?  

There are so many reasons to use GitHub. Personal organization, switching between your home and work computers, backing up, version control. Also for collaboration, sharing, learning, contributing. . .

## GitHub Structure

GitHub stores files in **repositories**, owned by an **organization**.  

Repositories ('repos') are essentially folders containing files pertaining to a specific project. Repositories are version controlled so that any modifications to files, additions or deletions, are tracked and attributed to contributors with the correct permissions. 

* [eco-data-science](https://github.com/eco-data-science) is an **organization**
* [github-intro](https://github.com/eco-data-science/github-intro) is a **repository**

*Let's navigate through a github repo: [eco-data-science/github-intro](https://github.com/OHI-Science/github-intro)*

## GitHub Workflow and Vocabulary

* **clone**: download to your computer from online version with synching capabilities enabled

![](fig/github_workflow1a.png)

## GitHub Workflow and Vocabulary

* **commit**: message associated with your changes ([best practices](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#commit-best-practices))

## GitHub Workflow and Vocabulary

* **pull**: sync a repo on your computer with the online version. Do this frequently.

## GitHub Workflow and Vocabulary

* **push**: sync the online repo with your version, only possible after committing

![](fig/github_workflow1.png)

## GitHub Workflow and Vocabulary

**sync ~ pull + commit + pull + push**  
All collaborators work independently but sync regularly

## GitHub Workflow: fork and pull

**fork + pull + commit + push + pull request**

![](fig/github_workflow_fork.png)


## Best Practices

**Pull often!**

**Commit frequently** 

**Be mindful of filepaths**

* We work from a in a folder in our home directory called ***'github'*** (all lowercase!), so that everyone can access the repo with the filepath beginning in `~/github`:

* **Windows**: `Users\[User]\Documents\github\`
* **Mac**: `Users/[User]/github/`

* *Please make a `github` folder in your home directory.*


## Cloning and Synching Options

You will clone a repo to your computer and work locally. 

When you work on your computer, any edits you make to any files in your repo, using any program, will be tracked by GitHub. You can then commit and sync your changes back to GitHub. There are many options you can use to first clone and then sync your edits on a repo with the online version:

* **GitHub App** [for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) and [for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
* [**RStudio**](www.rstudio.com)
* **shell (Terminal on Mac)**

*We will just use RStudio today.*
 
## Workflow and Practice Using RStudio

1. **fork a repo** to your user account
2. **clone the repo** to your computer
3. **edit a file**, ex [github-intro/test_script_ohi-uswest.Rmd](https://github.com/eco-data-science/github-intro/blob/master/sandbox/test_script_ohi-uswest.Rmd)
4. inspect differences
5. **commit** changes
6. **pull**
7. **push**
8. repeat!
